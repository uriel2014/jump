We originally were to design the website using CSS, HTML, Bootstrap and JQuery along
with Java Script.

However we simplified our results with the use of Bootstrap to create the CAROUSEL
animation in the webpage.

Furthermore, more notes are listed in that of the css file and that of the index.html
file.
